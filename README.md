# hShip, a ships game made with ASCII characters
hShip is a ships game made with ASCII characters for Windows, it was made by me, Hdb Programming using C/C++ programming languages but you can download it, modify it and redistribute it. You may have problems with the window's height and lenght if you use Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 or 8.1, to fix these problems you need to change the window's height to 30 and the window's lenght to 120.
